# AI-driven-Air-Quality-Prediction-using-Meteorological-and-Pollution-Data

### Project Overview
Air quality is a critical factor affecting public health and the environment. This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict air quality indices (AQI) based on meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and pollution data (levels of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3).

### Project Goals
###### Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset of historical air quality and meteorological data, clean and preprocess the data.
###### Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for the prediction model.
###### Model Development: Build and train a regression model to predict AQI.
###### Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
###### Deployment: Develop a web application to input current data and get AQI predictions.
### Steps for Implementation
##### 1. Data Collection
Use publicly available datasets such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Air Quality Dataset or other open government datasets.

##### 2. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalization: Normalize numerical features.
Splitting: Split the data into training and testing sets.
##### 3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., moving averages of pollutants).

##### 4. Model Development
Develop a machine learning regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or LSTM for time-series prediction).

##### 5. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

##### 6. Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask for the backend and a simple HTML/CSS frontend.
